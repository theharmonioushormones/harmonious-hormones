My mum has them and is still managing them to this day. My aunt had them too &nbsp;and later had a hysterectomy and developed breast cancer. I haven\u2019t seen any proven medical connection between fibroids and breast cancer, but it made me start wondering just how much our hormones influence our overall health. That experience pushed me to start asking more questions &nbsp;about fibroids, about hormone balance, and about the lack of clear research in women\u2019s reproductive health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">So, when I was diagnosed in 2022, I wasn\u2019t exactly shocked. My belly had been growing; it looked like I was five months pregnant. But I thought: <em>&#8220;I know people who live with fibroids. I\u2019ll be fine.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">The OB\/GYN said to me &nbsp;<em>\u201cYou can\u2019t just bury your head in the sand and ignore a problem expecting it to just go away,\u201d<\/em> &nbsp;that was my warning bell<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">I walked out of that clinic with a birth control prescription ikr, right? Don\u2019t judge me A whole fibroids diagnosis and we\u2019re talking about birth control? Later we will explore the effects of this on our hormones overall<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">I didn\u2019t do anything about this diagnosis and &nbsp;about a year later\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">One random afternoon, I was at the mall, shopping, running errands. Suddenly, a sharp pain hit the side of my stomach. I sat down. \u201cIt\u2019s just my period,\u201d I told myself. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten. Let me take some tea and a muffin and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">But the pain didn\u2019t go away. It eased up a bit, but lingered. I pushed through the day anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Later that night, the pain got way worse, I couldn\u2019t move properly. I was vomiting green bile. Couldn\u2019t eat. Couldn\u2019t even take a sip of water. I thought, <em>Maybe it\u2019s acidity?<\/em> I tried antacids, baking soda, and all the homemade tricks. Nothing worked. I couldn\u2019t sleep. The pain was becoming unbearable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Morning came. I told my sister I am not moving at all she had been receiving updates on my health throughout the night also her she thought that\u2019s just cramps from the periods or bloating<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Within 20 minutes, my family was at my door. They carried me to the car and rushed me to the emergency room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Diagnosis: fibroids. Emergency surgery.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">The fibroids had grown so large they were pressing on my colon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">It was traumatic. I kept thinking: <em>People live with fibroids. Why do I have to go through surgery?<\/em> But it had to be done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">That surgery changed me. I was alone. I was scared. I was going through a rough patch in life, wheeled into an operating room. And when I came out, the OB\/GYN told me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>\u201cYou need to have a baby within two years, or you\u2019ll need a hysterectomy.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Let that sink in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">At that point, I had no partner, I wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted kids. And now, apparently, having a baby was the \u201ccure\u201d?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">That moment became the turning point for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">I spent the next two years on a journey &nbsp;where I had taken on learning my body, researching, and changing my lifestyle. I adjusted my diet. I took supplements. I prioritized sleep and even changed careers roles, Why? Because I refused to go through that pain again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">And <strong>that<\/strong> is why I started this blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">To share what I\u2019ve learned.<br>To be a voice for the women who are confused, dismissed, overwhelmed.<br>To create a space where we can talk about fibroids, hormones, pain, surgery, fertility, emotions and more<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">You&#8217;re not alone. If you&#8217;re navigating this journey, I see you. I\u2019ve been there.<br>And I\u2019ll be sharing everything I\u2019ve learned &nbsp;including how to manage your hormones, track your cycle, and take charge of your health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>This is just the beginning.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Stick around. Let\u2019s walk along this path together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>And yes, that emergency surgery? It wasn\u2019t the last. I later had to go through another operation due to an adhesion a story I\u2019ll share in an upcoming post.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From Emergency Surgery to Starting This Blog Fibroids run in my family.
