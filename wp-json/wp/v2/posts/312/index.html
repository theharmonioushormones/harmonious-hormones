Another things is the energy levels in our cycle phases, on this <a href=\"\/cycle-and-workouts\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"307\">post <\/a>I have explained in depth the energy levels in each cycle phase so in the phases where your energy is low you need to boost this with carbohydrates and girl I don\u2019t mean go ham in burgers and fries I mean healthy carbohydrates. If you notice during luteal and menstrual phases we tend to have craving personally I crave cakes sweets and KFC so my body is signaling for high energy giving foods and during follicular and ovulation phase we have high energy this is where you focus on protein intake because your are the most active with workouts and activities you are busy as a bee these are high energy days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong both proteins and carbohydrates are required in all phases do not say I won\u2019t take proteins because I am in luteal no, take all the nutrients but be aware what your body needs more in each phase also let\u2019s not forget mineral and vitamins this is from vegetables and fruits take this daily. You need fiber too for proper gut health and probiotics for healthy bacteria..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Gut\u2013Hormone Connection<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gut health is really, and I can\u2019t stress this enough crucial for our hormones. Our gut is the control center. below I have shown how gut health connects to hormones<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Gut Role<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>What It Does for Hormones<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Estrogen Detox (Estrobolome)<\/strong><\/td><td>Your gut has specific bacteria (called the <em>estrobolome<\/em>) that help break down and remove excess estrogen. If your gut is unhealthy or constipated, estrogen can get <strong>reabsorbed<\/strong>, leading to <strong>estrogen dominance<\/strong> (hello, fibroids, PMS, breast tenderness).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Nutrient Absorption<\/strong><\/td><td>A healthy gut absorbs vitamins and minerals. Poor gut = poor absorption = hormone imbalance.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Cortisol + Stress Connection<\/strong><\/td><td>Your gut and brain are connected by the <strong>gut-brain axis<\/strong>. If your gut is inflamed, it can send stress signals to your brain, increasing <strong>cortisol<\/strong> (your stress hormone). High cortisol throws off your cycle, sleep, and fertility.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Mood + Serotonin<\/strong><\/td><td>Around <strong>90% of serotonin<\/strong> (your feel-good hormone) is made in your gut. So gut issues can lead to mood swings, anxiety, or PMS-related depression.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Inflammation + Hormonal Disorders<\/strong><\/td><td>Gut inflammation can trigger or worsen conditions like <strong>PCOS, endometriosis<\/strong>, and thyroid problems. An imbalanced gut creates <strong>chronic inflammation<\/strong>, which disrupts hormone communication.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hydration and the Liver<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us not forget hydration is crucial for your gut. Your water intake should be amazing, and I recommend the classic two liters per day. Excess sugar and processed food harm the gut flora<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>the liver is also crucial because it detoxes excess hormones like estrogen. If it becomes sluggish, especially from processed foods, stress, or alcohol, these hormones can build up and cause PMS, bloating, fatigue, and mood swings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alcohol and Hormones<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to alcohol, I know someone who drinks will not want to hear this, but alcohol is genereaally not good for the gut and liver and the brain chemicals because it disrupts the serotine and cortisol, wine is good for the gut but one too many isn\u2019t . I also need you to be&nbsp; aware that during luteal and menstrual cycle alcohol can be&nbsp; a huge disruptor because it &nbsp;increases PMS coz, I have mentioned it affects cortisol and serotine and can increase cravings. When it comes to alcohol just reduce consumption and none is even better<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enjoy Your Food: My Approach<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you read all this, I am sure like this diet sounds restrictive and not enjoyable, but food should be enjoyed and not feel like a punishment . personally, for me what works is the Mediterranean diet. It hits all my nutrients spots and it\u2019s enjoyable but what I would say is food depends on you and its personal so below I will give some sources of nutrients mentioned and pick what you like<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>also please keep in mind to not undereat when you trying to lose weight or over eat when you trying to gain , quantity of food is also essential<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/1-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/1-1-1024x576.png 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/1-1-300x169.png 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/1-1-768x432.png 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/1-1-1536x864.png 1536w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/1-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/2-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-402\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/2-1-1024x576.png 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/2-1-300x169.png 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/2-1-768x432.png 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/2-1-1536x864.png 1536w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/2-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To also make it easier on what to put on your plate always think rainbow your meals should look like a rainbow where it has vegetables protein carbs and fruits see below the pic that can guide. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"724\" height=\"1024\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Colorful-Eat-the-Rainbow-Healthy-Diet-Poster-724x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-405\" style=\"width:467px;height:auto\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Colorful-Eat-the-Rainbow-Healthy-Diet-Poster-724x1024.png 724w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Colorful-Eat-the-Rainbow-Healthy-Diet-Poster-212x300.png 212w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Colorful-Eat-the-Rainbow-Healthy-Diet-Poster-768x1086.png 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Colorful-Eat-the-Rainbow-Healthy-Diet-Poster-1086x1536.png 1086w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Colorful-Eat-the-Rainbow-Healthy-Diet-Poster-1448x2048.png 1448w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Colorful-Eat-the-Rainbow-Healthy-Diet-Poster.png 1587w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all hope this helps you in your diet journey and improves your body girlie<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hey girlie on this post I showed the various hormones that are at work in our bodies with each phase of our cycle, now the building and functioning blocks of these hormones come from our diet, cholesterol and amino acids build hormones then vitamins and minerals help in the functioning of the hormones i.e. they [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-312","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-harmonious-hormones-learn-flow"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/312","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=312"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/312\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":406,"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/312\/revisions\/406"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=312"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=312"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=312"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
