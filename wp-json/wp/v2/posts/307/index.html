However, one thing that as women we should consider is our hormones. Hormones affect our energy levels in each phase of the cycle, so this post focuses on how to plan your workouts accordingly. From this post about the phases in our cycle (<a href=\"\/know-your-hormones\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"285\">see link here<\/a>), I\u2019ve explained in depth what hormones are at play in each phase and how this manifests in our bodies.<br>Each phase comes with its own energy levels because of the hormone changes, which is why it\u2019s important to work out according to where your body is at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Menstrual Phase: Sloth Mode (Go Slowest) <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Think sloth: slow, still, grounded. Go slowest.<br>Hormone levels are low. Both estrogen and progesterone drop here.<br>This is when your body is in pain, bleeding and your hormone levels are low so generally you are moody, tired and unmotivated. Do not feel the pressure to go hard in this phase because you are doing more harm than good to your body. When you are in the menstrual cycle prioritize low impact calming workouts. Go for a walk in nature or park, if you have a house with a compound walk barefoot to ground yourself, do yoga, pilates. It&#8217;s not the time to be increasing and lift weights of 50kgs, just light weights. Also girlie it&#8217;s not time to just do nothing. When you are in pain rest, but on the 3rd day to 5th when the flow is low prioritize gentle movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Follicular Phase: Bunny Mode (Step It Up)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Think bunny: alert, energetic, playful. Step it up.<br>Estrogen is rising and brings energy and motivation.<br>The follicular phase is when estrogen levels start to rise and now you can go heavy with the weights that you are using. You can now focus on taking your workouts to the next level from gentle to strong. Best time for HIIT, resistance training and moderate cardio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ovulatory Phase: Gorilla Mode (Go Hardest)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Think gorilla: strong, powerful, unstoppable. Go hardest.<br>Estrogen is high and testosterone may give a strength boost.<br>The ovulatory phase is when now with the hormones you are at your peak, the energy levels are the highest and this is when you can do the heaviest weights. Do more strength, the highest level of your workouts should be here. The body has greatest energy for movement so the hardest routines of your workout are best done here. Lift heaviest, stairmaster, hiking depending on which you find the most challenging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Luteal Phase: Cat Mode (Slow It Down)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Think cat: do not disturb, move at your own pace. Slow it down.<br>Progesterone is rising and your energy starts to dip.<br>The luteal phase is now the body is slowing down and your energy is beginning to go low. This is when you start slowing down and incorporating the low intensity classes: the yoga, pilates, barre. It\u2019s the best time to do them. You can still include strength and cardio but not at your challenging levels but at your best. For example, you know you lift let\u2019s say 50kg easy, you can maintain that or run at your highest speed. Basically no new challenging workouts but more of maintain as you slow down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With all these guidelines in mind I promise you your workouts will not affect your hormones. I have been there where I go to the gym then my period starts going irregular because the hormones are not taken into account when I workout. Your workouts and hormones should be a team, not against each other. So if you notice your cycle isn\u2019t regular anymore or your hormones are imbalanced when you are working out (see how to tell from this <a href=\"\/hormonal-imbalance\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"301\">post<\/a>), use the above guidelines in your workout routine to get them on track.<br>As you now know, working out without considering your diet is working hard, not smart. See this <a href=\"\/cycle-and-diet\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"312\">post<\/a> also that gives a guide on hormones and diet. I have included an infographic to further illustrate workouts with the hormones<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In conclusion, a good workout and good diet that keeps hormones in mind is the best thing for your body. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"712\" height=\"637\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/cycle-workout-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-310\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/cycle-workout-screenshot.jpg 712w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/cycle-workout-screenshot-300x268.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lifestyle: working out Ladies we are always conditioned to workout thinking of calorie deficit, surplus or maintenance which is okay depending on your fitness goals.
