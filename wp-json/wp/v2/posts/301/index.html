So now, what happens when your periods are irregular? That\u2019s what we are exploring today: irregular periods meaning the hormone levels are imbalanced and this is noticed by having irregular cycles that is period that doesn&#8217;t last for 4-7 days and having a cycle out of the range of 21-35 days<br><br>So, hormonal imbalance is when your hormone levels are too high or too low during the cycle. Girlies, keep in mind each of our bodies is different, and learning your cycle patterns and listening to your body is a key thing for you to judge when things are right or wrong.<br><br>Now, another thing you may be wondering is what could have caused the hormones to be imbalanced. The causes vary. One is a hormonal or uterine condition such as PCOS, fibroids, cysts, and endometriosis. these are caused when our hormones are not balanced  For example, estrogen dominance contributes to fibroids and endometriosis.  Other causes are chronic stress if you are going through a stressful time or a mental health condition, lack of sleep, wrong workout regime, poor diet, underlying conditions like diabetes or autoimmune diseases also play a role, and birth control too.<br><br>Ladies now how do you  tell which hormone is imbalanced, the most accurate way is hormone testing in a medical facility. Note that this depends too on the day of the cycle. See the table below that gives you a good summary of the hormone tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th><strong>Hormone<\/strong><\/th><th><strong>Best Day to Test<\/strong><\/th><th><strong>Test Type<\/strong><\/th><th><strong>Test Name (What to Ask For)<\/strong><\/th><th><strong>What It Reveals<\/strong><\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Estradiol (E2)<\/strong><\/td><td>Cycle Day 3<\/td><td>Blood (serum)<\/td><td>\u201cEstradiol blood test\u201d<\/td><td>Baseline estrogen levels.

It happens in clusters that form consistent patterns. Also, you can experience imbalances in more than one hormone, for example, low progesterone and high estrogen during chronic stress or a sluggish liver.

What\u2019s next is what to do. The best way to keep your hormones balanced is through good gut health and a healthy lifestyle that includes a good workout and diet and sleep which is 8-9 hours. You can also check with your gynecologist which birth control they can recommend for you. Supplements are also an option to support hormonal balance when used correctly, and I\u2019ll be covering those in a separate post. As for any underlying conditions, we will explore them one by one in upcoming posts<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a healthy lifestyle please see the links  on <a href=\"\/cycle-and-diet\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"312\">diet <\/a>and <a href=\"\/cycle-and-workouts\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"307\">workout<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hormonal Imbalance In this post Know your Hormones\u2026, I have explained in detail what a balanced and regular cycle is and what hormones are usually at play in our bodies during our cycle.
